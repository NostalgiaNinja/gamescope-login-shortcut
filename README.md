# Gamescope Login shortcut

This is a quick shortcut that allows quick use for gamescope in Arch Linux. This is created for my personal use in case I nuke my Arch, but may be useful to those who want to log into Gamescope alone without needing to go to their primary DE.

## Prerequisites:

* Steam
* Gamescope binary

## How to Install:

Run `install.sh` as sudo to copy gamescope to the wayland-sessions directory.

If you are uncertain about the batch file, then you can do it yourself with the following command:

```sh

sudo cp gamescope.desktop /usr/share/wayland-sessions/

```

Restart your system and the option should become available to you next time you log in (through SDDM/ly)

## Caveats:

The Steam -> Switch to Desktop button does not work. For this purpose, it would be advised to send a pkill command in another tty or restart your system.
